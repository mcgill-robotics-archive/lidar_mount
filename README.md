# lidar-mount
Physical implementation of lidar mount for McGill Robotics.

For now we must build and run the Arduino code independently, as I did not take
the time to integrate the Arduino <-> catkin toolchain.

## TODOs
- Update the README.
- Update the launch files to include rviz launch.
- Integrate the Arduino <-> catkin toolchain.
